# ðŸ’¼ Pay Calculator with Overtime

This is an extended version of the basic pay calculator written in Python.  
It includes overtime calculation: if the employee works more than 40 hours, they are paid 1.5 times the hourly rate for extra hours.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter hours worked and hourly rate.
2. Converts both inputs to `float`.
3. Applies this logic:
   - If hours â‰¤ 40: pay = hours Ã— rate
   - If hours > 40:  
     - Regular pay = 40 Ã— rate  
     - Overtime pay = (hours - 40) Ã— rate Ã— 1.5  
     - Total pay = regular pay + overtime pay
4. Displays total pay using `print()
